                <CaseText size='exwide'>The primary brand mark as well as the variations I designed were in accordance with the brief provided by the business owner. The brief outlined that the words 'dog' and room' must connect to make the word 'groom', but only to the observant. The brief also outlined the use of black, white, yellow and the primary colours. I softened the colours in line with the friendly word mark and included the silhouette of the ownerâ€™s dog in the G and r, to further link the words.</CaseText>
