        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a designer that combines my understanding of front end web development, vector graphic and photography to create visually cohesive brand assets, and online media. </p>

        <h2>My First Computer</h2>
        <p>Disregarding the Nintendo DS I got one charismas, my first computer was a Microsoft Surface RT. A device which by all account was a failure, but for me it unlocked a world of possibilities if never before had access to. 
            I remember creating an animation of falling triangles on PowerPoint, my design software of choice when I was 12.</p>

        <h2>A Pen Without Paper</h2>
        <p>A few years after I got my Surface, I upgraded to another, the Surface 3. This time I got the Pen to go with it. I had always loved drawing and had wanted to try digital illustration. This was in 2015 and up until 2019, when I started using Affinity Designer, I used OneNote to draw. Despite it's limitations or perhaps because of them I found new ways of making what I wanted. If you scroll back enough on my Instagram you'll see.</p>

        <h2>Affinity By Serif</h2>
        <p>Despite using the Adobe suite while in school, cost led me to choose Affinity Desinger when looking for professional design software. With it I have created my best work to date, from designing this site, to working with businesses on branding. I can't recommend it enough for anyone with an interest. Robust vector tools allowed me to create high resolution art and design mathematically precise assets for countless projects.</p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>Both of my parents have a love of photography, that being how they met. I remember going through the boxes of negative my Mum has and seeing the years preserved. My Mum also loves design, in her case that's interior design, and I think it's from conversations with her that my understanding stems from. </p>

        <h2>My Perspective On UX</h2>
        <p>UX is usually a concept discussed in a digital landscape but the concepts stem from the real world. Software may have left skeuomorphism in the past, but what's on the screen isn't so different from IRL. Your news feed is a street, each webpage is a room and your profile is the cloths you put on. 
            The way things are designed impact how we go to interact with them. Everyoneâ€™s pushed a pull door in their life, but it's not your fault, it's the designer. We shouldn't settle for poor design, when it can be so much better.

        <h2>Overall</h2>
        <p>My story is unique, but only as unique as any other. My experience and perspective are my own, but I still draw a similar conclusion. Skills are an investment of time; this is how I've chosen to invest mine. To view things in less ambiguous terms, read my <a href="./resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>
